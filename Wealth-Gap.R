# How is average family wealth in the U.S. trending over time?

# To answer this question, we first need to filter the data for "Average" (not "Median") family wealth. Then we need to make a new dataframe from race_wealth with the average family wealth per year for all races
# Save this as `total_avg_wealth`
total_avg_wealth <-

# Now let's make a scatter plot of total average family wealth over time
ggplot()

# Now let's draw a line plot on top of the same scatterplot
ggplot()

# Let's plot family wealth over time by racial category

# Use the race_wealth dataframe and filter for only "Average" wealth `avg_race_wealth`
avg_race_wealth

# Let's make a line plot of average family wealth over time by race
ggplot()

# Finally, let's make a line plot of the percentage of homeowners for racial categories over time, and color by race
# Use the home_owner dataframe
ggplot()
